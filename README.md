# Styleguide Starter

The Starter UI toolkit is a highly-modular design system for rapid web page development. It contains different materials that can be assembled into more complex page layouts.

## Getting Started

Views > layouts > default.html -  This is the base layout fro the styleguide.
Add the link to your CSS and JS files here.
Then start to make each component.

## Using The Starter Styleguide
### Components
Components are small chunks of UI which can stand alone or be added together to create structures.
e.g. form components added to create a form.
Each component includes the following:
Example of the component
HTML Markup of component
Optional comments about the component e.g. use cases, best practises etc.


### Structures
Multiple components can be added together to make structures.

### Pages
Add multiple structures/components together to create new layouts
